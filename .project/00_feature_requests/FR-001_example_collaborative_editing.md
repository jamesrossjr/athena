# Feature Request: Real-time Collaborative Editing

**FR Number:** FR-001  
**Date Submitted:** 2025-01-10  
**Submitted By:** Product Team  
**Category:** Core Feature  
**Priority:** P1-High  
**Status:** Proposed  

## Executive Summary
Enable multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document in real-time, similar to Google Docs collaborative editing functionality.

## Problem Statement
Currently, ATHENA only supports single-user editing of documents. This limits team collaboration and requires manual coordination when multiple people need to work on the same content.
- Teams cannot work together on documents in real-time
- Users must manually merge changes from different versions
- No visibility into who is currently viewing or editing a document
- Collaboration requires external tools or manual coordination

## Proposed Solution
Implement real-time collaborative editing with:
- Live cursor positions for all active users
- Real-time text synchronization
- User presence indicators
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Collaboration history and attribution
- Comments and suggestions system

## User Stories
- As a team member, I want to see my colleagues' edits in real-time so that we can work together efficiently
- As a document owner, I want to control who can edit or view my documents so that I maintain document security
- As a user, I want to see who else is viewing the document so that I know who's available for collaboration
- As a reviewer, I want to leave comments and suggestions so that I can provide feedback without directly editing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously
- [ ] Changes appear in real-time (< 500ms latency)
- [ ] No data loss during concurrent editing
- [ ] Clear visual indicators of other users' cursors and selections
- [ ] System handles up to 10 concurrent editors per document
- [ ] Collaboration history is preserved and queryable

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Team Meeting Notes
- **Actor:** Meeting participants
- **Precondition:** Document is shared with team members
- **Steps:**
  1. Meeting organizer creates a new page document
  2. Shares document link with participants
  3. Multiple participants open the document
  4. All participants can add notes simultaneously
  5. Changes appear instantly for all viewers
- **Expected Result:** Complete meeting notes with contributions from all participants

### Use Case 2: Document Review
- **Actor:** Document reviewer
- **Precondition:** Document shared with review permissions
- **Steps:**
  1. Reviewer opens shared document
  2. Highlights text to comment on
  3. Adds comment or suggestion
  4. Author sees and responds to feedback
- **Expected Result:** Asynchronous feedback loop without version conflicts

## Technical Considerations
- **Architecture Impact:** Need WebSocket server for real-time communication
- **Database Changes:** Add collaboration tables for presence, cursors, and operation history
- **API Changes:** New WebSocket endpoints for collaboration events
- **Dependencies:** Consider using Yjs or OT (Operational Transformation) library
- **Performance Impact:** Increased server load for WebSocket connections
- **Security Implications:** Need robust access control for collaborative sessions

## Implementation Approach
1. Phase 1: Basic real-time sync with WebSockets
2. Phase 2: Cursor positions and user presence
3. Phase 3: Comments and suggestions system
4. Phase 4: Collaboration history and rollback

## Effort Estimate
- **Development:** 4-6 weeks
- **Testing:** 1-2 weeks
- **Documentation:** 3 days
- **Total:** 6-8 weeks

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk 1:** Conflict resolution complexity → **Mitigation:** Use proven CRDT/OT algorithms
- **Risk 2:** Performance at scale → **Mitigation:** Implement connection pooling and rate limiting
- **Risk 3:** Data consistency issues → **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and rollback capabilities

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Turn-based editing:** Users take turns editing - **Reason not chosen:** Too limiting for real collaboration
2. **Screen sharing only:** View-only collaboration - **Reason not chosen:** Doesn't allow active participation
3. **Third-party integration:** Embed Google Docs - **Reason not chosen:** Want native integration and data control

## Dependencies
- Depends on: User authentication system
- Blocks: Advanced permission management
- Related to: Document sharing feature

## Impact Analysis
- **User Impact:** High - affects all users who work in teams
- **Business Impact:** Major differentiator for team/enterprise adoption
- **Technical Debt:** Adds complexity but follows modern patterns
- **Maintenance Burden:** Moderate - requires monitoring WebSocket infrastructure

## Open Questions
1. Should we support offline collaboration with sync on reconnect?
2. What's the maximum number of concurrent editors we should support?
3. Should anonymous users be able to collaborate with restrictions?

## Stakeholder Sign-off
- [ ] Product Owner
- [ ] Technical Lead
- [ ] UX Designer
- [ ] QA Lead
- [ ] Engineering Manager

## Notes
This is a high-priority feature for Q2 2025 based on user feedback. Consider starting with basic collaboration on Page documents before expanding to other document types.
