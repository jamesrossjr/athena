# 🧠 Global AI System - The Lifeblood of Athena

## Overview

The Global AI System transforms Athena into a truly intelligent application where AI is not just a feature, but the **lifeblood** of the entire system. The AI can seamlessly interact with both chat and page content, understanding context and executing actions across the entire workspace.

## Key Features

### 🌟 **Unified AI Experience**
- **Single AI Brain**: One AI system powers both chat and page interactions
- **Context Awareness**: AI knows about your current document, recent actions, and workspace state
- **Seamless Integration**: Chat with AI or use page AI blocks - same intelligent assistant

### 🎯 **Executable Actions**
The AI can actually **DO THINGS** on your page:
```
[CREATE_BLOCK]New paragraph content[/CREATE_BLOCK]
[EDIT_BLOCK:0]Updated content for first block[/EDIT_BLOCK]
[ADD_HEADING]New Section Title[/ADD_HEADING]
[INSERT_TEXT]Text at cursor position[/INSERT_TEXT]
```

### 🔄 **Bidirectional Communication**
- **Chat → Page**: Ask AI to modify your document via chat
- **Page → Chat**: AI actions are reflected in chat conversation
- **Document Awareness**: AI always knows what document you're working on

## How It Works

### 1. **Global AI State** (`composables/useGlobalAi.ts`)
- Manages conversation history across chat and page
- Tracks document context and changes
- Handles action execution
- Maintains AI knowledge about your workspace

### 2. **Global AI Chat** (`components/GlobalAiChat.vue`)
- Beautiful floating AI assistant
- Context-aware suggestions
- Shows current document info
- Displays AI actions in conversation

### 3. **Intelligent API** (`server/api/ai/chat.post.ts`)
- Enhanced prompts for global AI mode
- Action tag processing
- Rich document context

### 4. **Page Integration** (`components/PaperInterface.vue`)
- Listens for AI actions
- Updates AI context when documents change
- Executes AI commands on page

## Usage Examples

### 💬 **Chat Examples**
```
User: "Add a new section about project timeline"
AI: "I'll add that section for you! [ADD_HEADING]Project Timeline[/ADD_HEADING]"
→ Creates heading block on page

User: "Make the first paragraph more engaging"
AI: "I'll improve that paragraph [EDIT_BLOCK:0]Here's a more engaging version...[/EDIT_BLOCK]"
→ Updates first block content

User: "What's this document about?"
AI: "Based on your document 'Project Proposal', it covers..." 
→ AI reads and understands current content
```

### 📄 **Page AI Examples**
```
1. Type `/ai` + Enter → Blue AI block appears
2. Type "help me brainstorm ideas for this project"
3. Press Enter → Generate button appears
4. Click Generate → AI responds with ideas AND creates new blocks
```

### 🔗 **Cross-Communication**
```
Chat: "Add a bullet list of key features"
→ AI creates list blocks on page
→ Page AI blocks can reference chat conversation
→ Everything stays in sync
```
