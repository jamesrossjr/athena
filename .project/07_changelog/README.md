# Changelog Directory

This directory contains detailed changelogs for all significant changes made to the ATHENA project.

## Structure

Each changelog entry follows the naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_XXX_description.md
```

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: Date of the change
- `XXX`: Sequential number for that day (001, 002, etc.)
- `description`: Brief description using underscores instead of spaces

## Categories

Changes are categorized as:
- **Feature**: New functionality added
- **Bug Fix**: Issues resolved
- **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing features
- **Configuration**: Build, deployment, or configuration changes
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates
- **Refactor**: Code restructuring without changing functionality

## Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Breaking changes or critical fixes
- **High**: Important features or significant bugs
- **Medium**: Standard features or non-critical issues
- **Low**: Minor improvements or cosmetic changes

## How to Add a Changelog Entry

1. Copy the `TEMPLATE.md` file
2. Rename it following the naming convention
3. Fill in all relevant sections
4. Delete any sections that don't apply
5. Commit the changelog with your code changes

## Best Practices

1. **Be Detailed**: Include enough information for someone to understand the change without looking at the code
2. **List Files**: Always list files that were created, modified, or deleted
3. **Document Dependencies**: Note any package additions or updates
4. **Include Commits**: Reference the commit hash for traceability
5. **Note Breaking Changes**: Clearly highlight any breaking changes
6. **Add Context**: Explain why the change was made, not just what was changed

## Automation

Consider setting up git hooks or CI/CD to automatically generate changelog entries from commit messages using conventional commit format.
