# Hierarchical Commands Test

## Feature Implementation Complete ✅

The hierarchical commands and navigation feature has been successfully implemented in the Command Palette. Here's what's been added:

### New Features

1. **Namespace Entry Points**
   - "Page" - Page-related commands
   - "Workspace" - Workspace-related commands  
   - "Format" - Text formatting commands
   - "Transform" - Page transformation commands

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - `→` or `Enter` - Enter a namespace
   - `←` or `Backspace` (empty search) - Exit namespace
   - `Esc` - Reset to root level or close palette

3. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Breadcrumb navigation showing current location
   - Grouped commands by namespace
   - Clear visual indicators for namespace entry points

### How to Test

1. **Open Command Palette** (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K)
2. **Browse Namespaces**: You'll see namespace categories like "Page", "Workspace", etc.
3. **Navigate Into Namespace**: 
   - Type "Page" and press Enter/→ to see page commands
   - Type "Format" and press Enter/→ to see formatting commands
4. **Navigate Back**: Press ← or Backspace (with empty search) to go back
5. **Search Within Namespace**: Type to search within the current namespace

### Implementation Details

- Commands are now organized by namespaces (Page, Workspace, Format, Transform)
- Breadcrumb navigation shows current location
- Keyboard shortcuts enhanced for hierarchical navigation
- Visual feedback for namespace entry points vs. regular commands
- Maintains existing search and execution functionality

### Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Commands can be defined within a namespace  
✅ Typing the namespace filters the list to show all commands within it  
✅ Selecting a namespace item and pressing Enter or Right Arrow transitions the palette to show only the sub-commands  
✅ Pressing Left Arrow or Backspace on an empty search bar navigates back to the parent level

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
