## üé≠ Persona System

This project includes a sophisticated persona system that allows you to work with specialized AI assistants:

### Available Personas

**üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Persona** (`npm run dev-persona`)
- Focus: Technical implementation, code architecture, performance
- Expertise: Vue 3, Nuxt 3, TypeScript, API design, debugging
- Communication: Direct, technical, with code examples

**üé® Designer Persona** (`npm run des-persona`)
- Focus: User experience, visual design, accessibility
- Expertise: UX/UI design, design systems, interaction patterns
- Communication: User-centered, visual, with design rationale

### Quick Commands
```bash
npm run dev-persona    # Activate Developer persona
npm run des-persona    # Activate Designer persona
npm run persona-status # Check current persona
npm run persona-reset  # Reset to default
```

## Current Context
The application features a revolutionary global AI system where:
- AI can execute actions on the page through chat commands
- AI maintains context across chat and document interactions
- AI can create, edit, and structure content directly
- AI provides specialized assistance based on active persona

## Working with Personas

When a persona is active, Claude will:
- Adopt the expertise and communication style of that role
