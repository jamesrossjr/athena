# Wiki-Style Page Linking System Implementation
**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Type:** Feature  
**Priority:** High  
**Author:** Claude Code Assistant  

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive wiki-style page linking system with bidirectional linking capabilities, enabling users to create interconnected knowledge graphs using [[Page Name]] syntax with autocomplete suggestions and automatic backlinks tracking.

## Changes
- Added wikigocument save operations
- Implemented page navigation functionality for clickable links
- Created reusable composable for page linking utilities

## Technical Details
The system uses pattern matching to detect [[Page Name]] syntax in real-time, triggering an autocomplete menu with available pages. When documents are saved, the system scans content for page links, updates the document's links array, and automatically maintains backlinks on referenced documents. The implementation uses Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript for type safety and maintains workspace-scoped document relationships.

## Files Created
- `composables/usePageLinks.ts` - Core page linking logic and utilities
- `components/DocumentBacklinks.vue` - UI component for displaying document backlinks

## Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added links and backlinks arrays to Document model
- `components/PageEditor.vue` - Added page link detection, autocomplete menu, and backlinks integration
- `components/PaperInterface.vue` - Integrated page link processing on document save operations

## Database Changes
```prisma
model Document {
  links       String[] @default([]) // IDs of documents this document links to
  backlinks   String[] @default([]) // IDs of documents that link to this document
}
```

## API Changes
- Enhanced document save operations to process page links and update bidirectional relationships
- Added link extraction and processing utilities for different document content structures

## Testing
- Verified page link pattern detection with [[Page Name]] syntax
- Tested autocomplete menu functionality with keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- Confirmed bidirectional link updates when documents are saved
- Validated backlinks UI component displays correctly at document bottom
- Tested page navigation functionality for clickable links
- Verified TypeScript compatibility and compilation success

## Performance Impact
- Debounced link rendering to minimize DOM updates during typing
- Efficient pattern matching using regex for real-time link detection
- Optimized document processing to update only changed links/backlinks

## Security Considerations
- Input sanitization for page link content to prevent XSS
- Workspace-scoped linking prevents cross-workspace data leakage

## Future Improvements
- Database persistence for links/backlinks (currently using localStorage)
- Link preview tooltips on hover
- Graph visualization of document relationships
- Link analytics and broken link detection
- Advanced search within linked documents

## Notes
- System is designed for future database integration while currently using localStorage
- Compatible with existing document block structure and content types
- Maintains backward compatibility with non-linked documents
