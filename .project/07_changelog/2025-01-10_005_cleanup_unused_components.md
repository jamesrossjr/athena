## Summary
Cleaned up the codebase by identifying and archiving unused Vue components and pages to improve project maintainability and reduce complexity.

## Changes
- Identified 18 unused components and 5 unused page directories
- Moved all unused files to organized archive structure
- Created comprehensive documentation for archived files
- Streamlined active codebase to focus on digital paper functionality

## Archive Structure Created
```
.project/09_archive/
├── README.md (documentation)
├── components/
│   ├── [18 component files]
│   └── blocks/
│       └── [5 block components]
└── pages/
    ├── briefings/
    ├── chat/
    ├── projects/
    ├── vault/
    └── test-login.vue
```

## Benefits
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Cleaner codebase with only active components
2. **Improved Build Times**: Fewer files to process during builds
3. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to understand active features
4. **Preserved History**: Code preserved for potential future use
5. **Clear Documentation**: Archive includes restoration instructions

## Performance Impact
- Reduced bundle size by removing unused components
- Faster development builds
- Cleaner dependency tree

## Notes
- All archived components were functional at time of archiving
- Components can be restored if needed in future
- Archive includes restoration instructions
- Consider permanent deletion after 6 months if unused

## Related Tasks
- Future: Review and update remaining components for consistency
- Future: Optimize imports in active components
- Future: Remove unused dependencies from package.json

## Commit Reference
- To be committed in next push
