**Document Type**: UX Design Guide  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: August 2025  
**Owner**: UX Design Team  

## Overview

This document defines the core interaction patterns that create Athena's distinctive user experience. These patterns ensure consistency across all features while supporting our goal of invisible, intelligent interface design.

## Core Interaction Philosophy

### 1. Command-First Interface
Every action in Athena should be accessible through the command palette, making keyboard navigation primary and mouse interaction secondary.

### 2. Contextual Assistance
The interface proactively suggests relevant actions based on current context, reducing cognitive load and improving discoverability.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
Complex features are hidden by default but instantly accessible when needed, maintaining interface simplicity while providing powerful capabilities.

### 4. Seamless Transformation
Content and interface elements should transform fluidly between states without jarring transitions or unexpected behavior.

## Universal Interaction Patterns

### Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + K)

The command palette is the universal entry point for all functionality in Athena.

#### Interaction Flow
```
1. User presses Ctrl/Cmd + K
2. Palette opens with focus on search input
3. User types command name or natural language description
4. Real-time filtering shows relevant commands
5. AI suggestions appear for natural language queries
6. User selects command via click or Enter key
7. Command executes or opens sub-menu for complex actions
```

#### Visual Behavior
- **Opening**: Fade in with gentle scale animation (200ms)
- **Searching**: Instant filtering with smooth result transitions
- **AI Processing**: Subtle loading indicator for AI interpretation
- **Execution**: Palette closes with confirmation feedback

#### Keyboard Navigation
```
Ctrl/Cmd + K    ‚Üí Open/close palette
‚Üë/‚Üì Arrow keys  ‚Üí Navigate commands
Enter           ‚Üí Execute selected command
Tab             ‚Üí Navigate between sections
Escape          ‚Üí Close palette
Ctrl/Cmd + 1-9  ‚Üí Execute numbered command
```

### Global AI Assistant

The AI assistant provides contextual help and automation across all page types.

#### Activation Methods
- **Sidebar Toggle**: Click AI icon in interface
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Ctrl/Cmd + J
- **Natural Language**: Type natural language in command palette
- **Context Menu**: Right-click for AI suggestions

#### Interaction States
1. **Dormant**: Subtle indicator showing AI availability
2. **Listening**: Active indicator showing AI is processing
3. **Suggesting**: Floating suggestions appear contextually
4. **Conversational**: Full chat interface for complex interactions

### Page Transformations

Pages can seamlessly transform between different types while preserving content.

#### Transformation Flow
```
1. User selects page type from command palette or toolbar
2. Content analysis determines transformation approach
3. Loading state with progress indication
4. Smooth morphing animation between layouts
5. New page type tools and interface elements appear
6. Content is restructured but preserved
```

#### Supported Transformations
- **Document ‚Üí Database**: Text becomes rows, headings become columns
- **Database ‚Üí Kanban**: Rows become cards, status column determines lanes
- **Whiteboard ‚Üí Document**: Shapes and text become structured content
- **Any ‚Üí Calendar**: Date fields become calendar events

### Universal Linking System

All content elements can be linked to create relationships and references.

#### Link Creation
1. **Drag and Drop**: Drag any element onto another to create link
2. **Keyboard**: Select element, press Ctrl/Cmd + L, choose target
3. **Command Palette**: "Link to..." command with fuzzy search
4. **AI Assistant**: Natural language linking commands

#### Link Visualization
- **Inline Links**: Subtle underline with hover preview
- **Backlinks**: Panel showing incoming references
- **Link Graph**: Visual representation of connections
- **Link Suggestions**: AI-powered relationship recommendations
