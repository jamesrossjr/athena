## Anti-Personas

### The Casual Note-Taker
While we want to be accessible, we're not optimizing for users who only take simple notes. Our focus is on knowledge workers with complex organizational needs.

### The Enterprise IT Administrator  
We're building for end-users, not IT departments. While we'll support enterprise features eventually, individual user experience takes priority.

### The Offline-First User
Our collaboration-focused approach requires internet connectivity. Users who primarily work offline aren't our primary target.

## Persona Usage Guidelines

### Product Decisions
- All feature decisions should be validated against at least two primary personas
- When personas conflict, Alex's needs take priority for core features
- Dr. Martinez's needs guide academic and research-specific features
- Marcus's needs inform visual design and creative workflows

### Design Validation
- User interface designs should be tested with representatives of each persona
- Information architecture should work for all three thinking styles
- Feature complexity should be appropriate for lowest common denominator

### Marketing & Communication
- Use persona language and terminology in product copy
- Address specific pain points in marketing materials
- Create content that resonates with each persona's professional context
